# Task 2

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Write [Align columns](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Align_columns)

## Description

Use the following text to test your programs:

<pre>
Given$a$text$file$of$many$lines,$where$fields$within$a$line$
are$delineated$by$a$single$'dollar'$character,$write$a$program
that$aligns$each$column$of$fields$by$ensuring$that$words$in$each$
column$are$separated$by$at$least$one$space.
Further,$allow$for$each$word$in$a$column$to$be$either$left$
justified,$right$justified,$or$center$justified$within$its$column.
</pre>

Note that:

1. The example input texts lines may, or may not, have trailing dollar characters.
2. All columns should share the same alignment.
3. Consecutive space characters produced adjacent to the end of lines are insignificant for the purposes of the task.
4. Output text will be viewed in a mono-spaced font on a plain text editor or basic terminal.
5. The minimum space between columns should be computed from the text and not hard-coded.
6. It is not a requirement to add separating characters between or around columns.

## My Comments

I'm not sure how to interpret the point 5 above in the context of the whole task.
