* Exercises
** Exercise 1
Exercise 1 from [[https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/defining-types-streamlining-functions.html#id585938][the exercises]].

*** Problem
Examine the type `List` below

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results value

:{
data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil
  deriving (Show)

fromList (x:xs) = Cons x (fromList xs)
fromList []     = Nil
:}

(fromList "tom", fromList [1..2])

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Cons | t | (Cons o (Cons m Nil)) | Cons | 1 | (Cons 2 Nil) |

Write the converse of `fromList` for the `List` type: a function that takes a
`List a` and generates a `[a]`.

*** Solution

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results value

:{
-- Cl - Common Lisp style list
-- Hs - Haskell style list
data ClList a = Cons a (ClList a) | Nil
  deriving (Show)

fromHs2Cl :: [a] -> ClList a
fromHs2Cl []     = Nil
fromHs2Cl (x:xs) = Cons x (fromHs2Cl xs)

fromCl2Hs :: ClList a -> [a]
fromCl2Hs Nil         = []
fromCl2Hs (Cons x xs) = x : fromCl2Hs xs
:}

(fromCl2Hs $ fromHs2Cl "tom", fromCl2Hs $ fromHs2Cl [1..2])

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| tom | (1 2) |

** Exercise 2
Exercise 2 from [[https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/defining-types-streamlining-functions.html#id585938][the exercises]].

*** Problem
Examine the type `Tree` below

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results value

:{
data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) | Empty
  deriving (Show)
:}

#+END_SRC

Define a tree type that has only one constructor, like our [[https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/defining-types-streamlining-functions.html#Tree.java:Tree][Java example]]. Instead
of the `Empty` constructor, use the `Maybe` type to refer to a node's children.

You may need to surround the code snippets with `:{` and `:}`. [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48446/haskell-code-execution-in-org-mode-give-error-but-in-hs-file-the-code-is-good-a][Explanation]].
