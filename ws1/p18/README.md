# Info

Solving some tasks in Haskell 'at a whim'.

The tasks are from [99 Problems (solved) in OCaml](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) solved with Haskell [to give it (the language and functional programming) another try].

# Problem

Extract a slice from a list. (medium)

Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 0 (this is the way the List module numbers elements).

<pre>
# slice ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"; "i"; "j"] 2 6;;
- : string list = ["c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"]
</pre>
