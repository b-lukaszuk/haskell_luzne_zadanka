# Info

Solving some tasks in Haskell 'at a whim'.

The tasks are from [99 Problems (solved) in OCaml](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) solved with Haskell [to give it (the language and functional programming) another try].

# Problem

Rotate a list N places to the left. (medium)

<pre>
# rotate ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"] 3;;
- : string list = ["d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"; "a"; "b"; "c"]
# rotate ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"] (-2);;
