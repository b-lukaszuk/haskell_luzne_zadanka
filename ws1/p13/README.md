# Info

Solving some tasks in Haskell 'at a whim'.

The tasks are from [99 Problems (solved) in OCaml](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) solved with Haskell [to give it (the language and functional programming) another try].

# Problem

Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution). (medium)

## My Notes

I skip that one, the problem description is unclear and it seems to be similar to Problem 11 that I solved (doing it another time is boring).
