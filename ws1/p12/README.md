# Info

Solving some tasks in Haskell 'at a whim'.

The tasks are from [99 Problems (solved) in OCaml](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) solved with Haskell [to give it (the language and functional programming) another try].

# Problem

Decode a run-length encoded list. (medium)

Given a run-length code list generated as specified in the previous problem, construct its uncompressed version.

<pre>
# decode [Many (4, "a"); One "b"; Many (2, "c"); Many (2, "a"); One "d"; Many (4, "e")];;
- : string list =
["a"; "a"; "a"; "a"; "b"; "c"; "c"; "a"; "a"; "d"; "e"; "e"; "e"; "e"] </pre>
</pre>
