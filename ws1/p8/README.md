# Info

Solving some tasks in Haskell 'at a whim'.

The tasks are from [99 Problems (solved) in OCaml](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html) solved with Haskell [to give it (the language and functional programming) another try].

# Problem

Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements. (medium)

Example:

<pre>
# compress ["a"; "a"; "a"; "a"; "b"; "c"; "c"; "a"; "a"; "d"; "e"; "e"; "e"; "e"];;
- : string list = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "a"; "d"; "e"]
</pre>
