## Intermission: Equivalence Exercises

Which of the following is equivalent to the lsted lambda term

`\xy.xz == \mn.mz`
rationale: the same formula, different letters
<br><br>
`\xy.xxy == \a.(\b.aab)`
rationale: before we transformed formula `\xyz.xz(yz) to (\x.\y.\z.xz(yz))` (division of function with three arguments to three functions with one argument each) so we can reverse the proces and transform `\a.(\b.aab) to \ab.aab` which is equal to `\xy.xxy` (the same formula different letters)
<br><br>
`\xyz.zx == \tos.st`
rationale: the same formula, different letters
