## Mutliplication

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The solutions are in the folder `multiplication/`

Use `hspec` to test Your recursive multiplication function from chapter 08.

Files created by me:
- LICENSE
- multiplication.cabal
- Multiplication.hs

Then I typed:

```bash
stack init
stack build
stack ghci
```

It created additional files (they are ignored -> see .gitignore)
